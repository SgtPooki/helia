## HeliaInit.holdGcLock property

Garbage collection requires preventing blockstore writes during searches for unpinned blocks as DAGs are typically pinned after they've been imported - without locking this could lead to the deletion of blocks while they are being added to the blockstore.

By default this lock is held on the main process (e.g. node cluster's primary process, the renderer thread in browsers) and other processes will contact the main process for access (worker processes in node cluster, webworkers in the browser).

If Helia is being run wholly in a non-primary process, with no other process expected to access the blockstore (e.g. being run in the background in a webworker), pass true here to hold the gc lock in this process.

**Signature:**

```typescript
holdGcLock?: boolean;
```
